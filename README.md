# Learning ARM64 ASM Journey

## Background
So I decided that I want to learn asm out of nowhere, after going tohrough AOSP rabbit hole
to make things more interesting, I will only use VIM as my IDE.

ps : ASM is different for each architecture, so for you guys who wants to learn the asm in the apple silicon, feel free to use this repository as your learning resource.


## Details :
- Platform & Architecture : `Apple Silicion Arm64 M2` Macbook Air 2022 (8/256)

// memory and register convention
//

common conventions for ARM64 registers:

x0 - x7 (and w0 - w7): These are general-purpose registers. x0 and w0 are commonly used for function return values. Parameters are often passed in x0 to x7.

x8 - x15 (and w8 - w15): These are callee-saved registers. If a function uses these registers, it must save and restore their values.

x16 (and w16): This register is often used for the system call number when making system calls (e.g., svc 0).

x17 (and w17): This register is often used as an alternative link register (lr) for branch instructions.

x18 - x28 (and w18 - w28): These are callee-saved registers. Similar to x8 to x15, if a function uses these registers, it must save and restore their values.

x29 (and w29): This is the frame pointer (fp).

x30 (and w30): This is the link register (lr). It is used to store the return address of function calls.

sp (and wsp): The stack pointer.

pc (and wpc): The program counter.
